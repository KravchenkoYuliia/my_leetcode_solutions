# Greedy Algorithm

- is a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step that looks the best at the moment
-  do not always give the best solution. For example, in coin change and 0/1 knapsack problems - the best solution is Dynamic Programing

Examples:

- Fractional Knapsack
- Dijkstra's algorithm 
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Huffman coding
- Prim's Algorithm
