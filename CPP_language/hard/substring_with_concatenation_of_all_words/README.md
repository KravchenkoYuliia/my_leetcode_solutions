## Hash Table
	is a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly
	- `key` -> `value`
	
	use for : 
		- search
		- count
		- check "has it been before?"

### Unordered Map
	is an associative container that stores unique key–value pairs using hashing, offering fast access. Unlike map, it does not maintain elements in sorted order
